# 🧠 TumorVision – Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

![TumorVision Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/surendrak21/TumorVision/main/assets/banner.webp)

## 📌 Project Overview

**TumorVision** is a deep learning project that classifies brain MRI scans into two categories:  
- **Tumor Present**  
- **No Tumor**  

It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automated brain tumor detection, aiming to assist doctors and radiologists with faster and more accurate diagnoses.

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 📊 NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- 🧠 TensorFlow / Keras  
- 🖼 OpenCV / Pillow  
- 📝 Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧬 Dataset

The dataset consists of **MRI brain images**, organized into two folders:  
- `yes` → Tumor present  
- `no` → Tumor not present  

All images are preprocessed (resized & normalized) before being used for training.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)  
- ✅ Binary classification with CNN  
- ✅ Accuracy & loss visualization during training  
- ✅ Sample predictions on test images with visual results
